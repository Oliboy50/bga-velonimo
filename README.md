> Board Game Arena adaptation of a card game named Velonimo

## Reminders

### Create sprite of cards

- Resize 180px wide PNG card images to be 90px wide and create sprite from them:
  ```shell
  magick montage $(ls blue-*.png) $(ls brown-*.png) $(ls gray-*.png) $(ls green-*.png) $(ls pink-*.png) $(ls red-*.png) $(ls yellow-*.png) jersey.png $(ls adventurer-*.png) -geometry +0+0 -tile 7x8 -mode concatenate -background none -resize 90 montage.png
  ```
- Reduce generated sprite size by ~90% sending it to https://tinypng.com
