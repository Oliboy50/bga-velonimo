> Board Game Arena adaptation of a card game named Velonimo

## Reminders

### Create sprite of cards

- Create sprite from 180px wide PNG card images:
  ```shell
  magick montage $(ls blue-*.png) $(ls brown-*.png) $(ls gray-*.png) $(ls green-*.png) $(ls pink-*.png) $(ls red-*.png) $(ls yellow-*.png) $(ls special-*.png) back-ext_legendes.png $(ls adventurer-*.png) -geometry +0+0 -tile 7x9 -mode concatenate -background none cards.png
  ```
- Create finish.png sprite from 150x150 finish images:
  ```shell
  magick montage $(ls finish_*.png) -geometry +0+0 -tile 4x1 -mode concatenate -background none finish.png
  ```
- Reduce generated sprite size by ~90% (using https://tinypng.com or https://compresspng.com if the file is too large)
